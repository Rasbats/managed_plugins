Cloudsmith is the deployment repository which hosts the tarballs that form
the heart of the managed plugin system.

== Sign Up

This is easiest using your GitHub account. Signing up is free and you
start a ``Free Trial''. You will get an email from Cloudsmith after a
few days:

`Just a friendly reminder that your trial subscription on Cloudsmith to the`
`Package (FREE) plan is due to run out 2 days, 23 hours from now.`

The paid plan is not necessary. The extra features are not required for
creating repositories for your plugin.

== Joining the Cloudsmith OpenCPN organisation

This step is optional. A membership is not required to create
repositories, but makes it possible to create them in the same area as
some other plugins. However, creating the same repositories
without being part of the organization works just fine.

*To Join* Send an email to Rick Gleason, Jon Gough or Dave Register
requesting an invite. This will then be generated by Cloudsmith. FIXME:
email addresses needed…

Good news! You’ve been invited by Rick Gleason (@rick-gleason) to be a
member of the OpenCPN (@opencpn) organization at Cloudsmith.

What can members do? They can see other members and visible teams, and
inherit privileges from the org and team membership..

You’ll need to login to your account to accept or reject the invite:
https://cloudsmith.io/user/login/[https://cloudsmith.io/user/login/]

After you login you will automatically find the invite within the
organization invites section of your user settings:
https://cloudsmith.io/user/settings/orgs/invites/[https://cloudsmith.io/user/settings/orgs/invites/]

Accept/reject the invitation:
https://cloudsmith.io/orgs/opencpn/people/invites/fCRGknS1o0IXDV4U/[https://cloudsmith.io/orgs/opencpn/people/invites/fCRGknS1o0IX/]

If you accept the invitation then your user account will join the
OpenCPN (@opencpn) organization at Cloudsmith. Please note that because
this invitation was sent to Mike Rossiter (@mike-rossiter) only *_that
specific account_* will be able to accept the invitation.

*This gives member rights which allows setting up repositories on
Cloudsmith for the tarballs and metadata files built by the virtual
machines.*

*Once the invite is accepted you will see the OpenCPN organisation
details.*

*Many repositories have packages already in place.*

== Create the repositories.

As mentioned, this works in the same way if using the cloudsmith organization
or not. Eventually, three repositories could be configured. The names
are formally arbitrary, but usually named like

  - _Tidefinder-Alpha_ ur _tidefinder-unstable_: This is basically a scratch
     build repository.
  - _Tidefinder-Beta_: The repository for beta builds.
  - _Tidefinder-Prod_ or _tidefinder-stable_: The repository for stable
    builds i. e., builds published to end users.

The beta repository is not required, just using two repositories like 
stable/unstable also works fine.

To create the repositories for TideFinder click the plus sign at the right
of the screen.

*Enter the details for the repository starting with the alpha
(unstable) repo.*

*Repeat for the beta and prod (stable) repositories.*

*Three repos have been created.*

== Retention life of the repositories

For repos within the Cloudsmith opencpn organisation it is possible to use the setting *Artifact Lifecycle*.

Repeat for the beta and prod (production) repositories.

Repos outside the opencpn organisation cannot use the lifecycle without a subscription (non-free). Any number of packages can be added to the repos. Tarballs and metadata files are retained indefinitely. Be aware that in this case there is a limit of 50gb storage. Also a bandwidth of 200gb a month applies for uploads. This is reset to zero at the start of a new month.

*While using Cloudsmith make a note of the API Key. This can be
copy/pasted to a file on your PC for use later.*
